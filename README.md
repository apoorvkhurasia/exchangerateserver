This server provides randomly generated exchange rates for educational purposes.
It is designed to teach learners how to consume a REST API and build a fast
and responsive UI which responds efficiently to fast changing data.

The data produced by this server is random and must not be assumed correct. It should
only be used for educational purposes and never for making any financial decisions.

## Getting started

`mvn clean install`

Then go to `http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html` to discover the API
